## Overview
In Alien Invaders, the player controls a ship that appears at 
the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship 
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the 
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky 
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and 
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet 
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits 
the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player 
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

## Game Description

* The ship is allowed to move horizontally only using the leftwards arrow and rightwards arrow keys on the keyboard, the bullets are fired when the space-bar is pressed. Players can only have 5 bullets present on each screen.

* If the player loses all ships the game ends   
* Once the player kills all the aliens present at the screen, the player moves on to the next level.
